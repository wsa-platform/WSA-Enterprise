# ADR-023 — Scientific Source Expansion Governance and GO-0 / STEP-1 Record

**Status:** PROPOSED — Source Expansion governance record  
**Scope:** Scientific Source Expansion / 62-source expansion phase  
**Date:** 2026-09-29  
**Branch at audit:** `phase-18-m18-ai-marketing-communications`  
**Audit HEAD:** `505f3e6f5d29d087b1303794b224236784563d43`  
**Origin at audit:** `3946e4fe574382472228f524dd87d9f62defb18a`

> This record archives the first source-expansion prompt and the resulting Cursor forensic report. It is append-only in intent: later prompts/reports/decisions should be added chronologically and superseded decisions must remain visible.

## 1. Architectural invariants for source expansion

1. **Scientific Question Identity Preservation:** the Canonical Scientific Question (CSQ) remains the semantic authority. A source-specific query is an execution representation and must not redefine the scientific question.
2. **Scientific Answer Identity Preservation:** source transport, ranking, wording, or metadata must not redefine the scientific answer. Evidence, validation, and Composer contracts remain authoritative.
3. **Strong Query Construction:** source expansion must preserve all scientifically material constraints while allowing source-appropriate query syntax, variants, filters, and capabilities.
4. New transport-source integration must not require changes to CSQ, RSC, or AnswerComposer unless a separately proven semantic requirement exists.
5. The current extension boundary is Adapter + Registry, plus Selector when a source is auto-selected.
6. The 62-source list is authoritative for this expansion phase and must not be silently renamed, merged, split, reordered, or replaced by inferred identities.
7. No first source is selected by this record.

## 2. Archived Prompt — GO-0 / STEP-1 Read-Only Architectural Discovery

```text
WSA-Enterprise — Scientific Source Expansion
GO-0 / STEP-1 — READ-ONLY ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY

OBJECTIVE

We are beginning the Scientific Source Expansion phase of WSA-Enterprise.

The purpose of this task is NOT to implement a new source.

The purpose is to perform a strict READ-ONLY forensic inspection of the existing repository and determine:

1. Where the official architectural decision / documentation for Scientific Source Expansion should live.
2. Where the authoritative 62-source master list should be stored in the repository.
3. How the repository currently represents architectural decisions, source contracts, ADRs, research contracts, and scientific-search documentation.
4. Whether an existing canonical document already exists that should be extended instead of creating a new competing document.
5. What documentation structure can preserve the complete history of:
   - source-expansion decisions
   - Cursor prompts
   - Cursor reports
   - GO decisions
   - source capability assessments
   - implementation findings
   - validation results
   - risks
   - failure criteria
6. Verify that the future source-expansion architecture can preserve the scientific identity of both:
   - the user's scientific question
   - the final scientific answer
7. Verify that the architecture can support strong, source-appropriate scientific query construction without changing the meaning of the scientific question.

THIS IS A READ-ONLY TASK.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILE.
DO NOT CREATE ANY FILE.
DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE.
DO NOT RENAME ANY FILE.
DO NOT FORMAT OR AUTO-FIX ANY FILE.
DO NOT RUN MIGRATIONS.
DO NOT CHANGE DATABASE STATE.
DO NOT MODIFY GIT STATE.

Do not modify protected WIP.

==================================================
BASELINE / DOCUMENTATION / 62-SOURCE LIST
==================================================

Inspect the repository for existing ADRs, architecture documents, scientific-search contracts, source integration documentation, canonical contracts, source registries/profiles, query compilation/construction, evidence identity, relevance, answer synthesis, and related tests.

Determine the canonical documentation location for Source Expansion and whether a new dedicated ADR is preferable without competing with ADR-022/CSQ or ADR-021 remediation history.

Use the established authoritative 62-source list from the Scientific Source Expansion audit. Do not invent, rename, merge, split, or reorder identities. Verify repository presence and distinguish dedicated integration, indirect aggregator coverage, documentation-only mention, inactive profile, unrelated token match, and unknown.

==================================================
SCIENTIFIC IDENTITY
==================================================

Inspect CSQ, Query Understanding, ScientificSearchQueryBuilder, ScientificQueryCompiler, source adapters, selection, normalization, evidence identity, relevance, AnswerComposer, AccuracyGate, RelevanceGate, final-answer confidence, Results List, and Viewer.

Verify:
- original scientific intent remains authoritative
- source cannot silently redefine the question
- source syntax may vary while scientific meaning remains unchanged
- query rewriting cannot introduce unsupported scientific claims
- essential constraints cannot be silently dropped
- adapter cannot redefine the ask
- final answer remains grounded in evidence answering the same question
- new source integration does not require CSQ semantic changes merely for transport/API differences

==================================================
STRONG SCIENTIFIC QUERY CONSTRUCTION
==================================================

Determine:
1. semantic authority
2. HTTP/query execution authority
3. ScientificQueryCompiler role
4. ScientificSearchQueryBuilder role
5. whether source-appropriate queries can be produced without CSQ change
6. whether multiple query variants preserve one scientific intent
7. capability-aware adaptation
8. information that must never be lost during compilation

Do not describe the compiler as HTTP authority if the repository shows ScientificSearchQueryBuilder remains the executing authority. Do not invent a dual-authority conflict without runtime evidence.

==================================================
ANSWER IDENTITY / SOURCE CAPABILITY / EXTENSION BOUNDARY
==================================================

Inspect answer identity protection, source capabilities, adapter/registry/selector/profile/compiler/normalizer/configuration/bridge/tests, and Home/Crop isolation.

Determine the minimum required integration for auto-selected and optional-only sources. Do not assume a fixed number of files per source.

==================================================
FAILURE CRITERIA
==================================================

Assess FC-1 through FC-7:
FC-1 question identity changes
FC-2 essential constraint lost
FC-3 source query overrides CSQ
FC-4 evidence traceability failure
FC-5 Composer semantics change
FC-6 Home/Crop regression
FC-7 bypass of required gates

For each, report current protection, existing tests, missing expansion test, and evidence. Do not implement tests.

==================================================
DOCUMENTATION GOVERNANCE
==================================================

Determine the safest repository location for the canonical Scientific Source Expansion decision record.

The structure must support automatic chronological accumulation of:
- architectural decisions
- prompts sent to Cursor
- Cursor reports
- forensic findings
- GO-0 through GO-5 decisions
- source assessments
- implementation notes
- validation results
- failures
- corrections
- superseded decisions

Historical information must not be silently erased.

==================================================
NO SOURCE SELECTION
==================================================

Do not select, rank, score, or recommend a first source. Do not implement any source.

==================================================
FINAL REPORT
==================================================

Return:
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. BASELINE
3. CANONICAL DOCUMENTATION LOCATION
4. 62-SOURCE REPOSITORY PRESENCE
5. SCIENTIFIC QUESTION IDENTITY
6. SCIENTIFIC ANSWER IDENTITY
7. STRONG QUERY CONSTRUCTION
8. SOURCE EXTENSION BOUNDARY
9. HOME / CROP ISOLATION
10. FAILURE CRITERIA FC-1..FC-7
11. DOCUMENTATION GOVERNANCE
12. GO-0 READINESS
13. OPEN QUESTIONS
14. RECOMMENDED NEXT READ-ONLY STEP

End with:
READ-ONLY FORENSIC AUDIT COMPLETE.
NO FILES MODIFIED.
NO GIT MUTATION PERFORMED.
```

## 3. Archived Cursor Report — GO-0 / STEP-1

### Executive findings

- No committed canonical document currently existed for Scientific Source Expansion or the 62-source master list.
- CSQ is the semantic authority.
- `ScientificSearchQueryBuilder` is the HTTP/query execution authority.
- `ScientificQueryCompiler` is metadata-only in the current implementation.
- Answer identity is protected by validation, Composer, accuracy, and directness contracts.
- No source was selected and no implementation was performed.

### Baseline

- Branch: `phase-18-m18-ai-marketing-communications`
- HEAD: `505f3e6f5d29d087b1303794b224236784563d43`
- Origin: `3946e4fe574382472228f524dd87d9f62defb18a`
- Ahead: 1
- Behind: 0
- Working tree: dirty with protected WIP
- Index: empty
- Git mutation during audit: none

### Documentation location identified

The report identified these relevant authorities:

- `docs/architecture/ADR-internet-first-agricultural-ai-research-agent.md`
- `docs/adr/ADR-001-provider-adapter-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-022-canonical-scientific-question-v1.md`
- `docs/architecture/CSQ-V1-ARCHITECTURE-DECISION-CLOSURE.md`
- `docs/architecture/WSA-ENTERPRISE-ARCHITECTURAL-DECISIONS-R1-R7.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-021-…`
- `docs/adr/README.md`

The report recommended a dedicated source-expansion ADR and a separate authoritative 62-source register, with an append-only expansion record area. It explicitly recommended not folding source-expansion logistics into ADR-022 or ADR-021.

### 62-source repository presence

- Dedicated Stage-3 integration among the 62: none.
- Inactive profiles: AGRIS (#1), AGRICOLA (#55), GBIF (#56).
- Docs-only mention: AGRIS and PubMed outside the 62 list.
- Indirect aggregator coverage: inconclusive.
- Remaining 59: no dedicated repository integration identified.
- Inactive profiles outside the list: PubMed and Europe PMC.

### Scientific Question Identity

CSQ remains authoritative from QUS through planning, RSC, query variants, orchestration, and adapters.

The report confirmed:
- intent authority: confirmed
- source syntax variation without semantic change: confirmed
- adapter redefinition of the ask: forbidden contractually
- new-source expansion without CSQ semantic change: confirmed intent

Expansion gaps identified:
- no dedicated per-source question-identity regression test
- legacy paths without CSQ could still misuse `originalQuestion`
- adapter filter omission remains a risk

### Scientific Answer Identity

Confirmed protections include:
- claim_relation / directness
- AnswerExpressionAccuracyGate
- confidence / expressible-claim rules
- separation of ranking from truth
- existing Results List / Viewer contracts

The report noted a remaining risk that a weak new-source normalizer could inject bad metadata.

### Strong Query Construction

The report confirmed:

- Semantic authority: CSQ + RetrievalSpecification
- HTTP execution authority: `ScientificSearchQueryBuilder`
- Compiler: `ScientificQueryCompiler` → options metadata
- Builder: CSQ-first query variant construction
- Multiple variants: supported
- Capability-aware adaptation: partial
- No proven dual HTTP authority conflict

The information that must remain invariant includes entity/target/process/property/relation, required geography/time, evidence requirements, and resolution state.

### Source extension boundary

For auto-selected sources:
- Adapter: required
- Registry: required
- Selector: required
- Profile: optional
- Compiler change: not required
- Normalizer/client: as needed
- Config flag: recommended
- Intelligence bridge: optional
- Tests: recommended
- CSQ/RSC/AnswerComposer: not required

For optional-only sources:
- Adapter: required
- Registry: required
- Selector: not required
- Profile: optional
- Compiler change: not required
- Normalizer/client: as needed
- Config flag: optional
- Intelligence bridge: optional
- Tests: recommended
- CSQ/RSC/AnswerComposer: not required

No separate Source Integration Layer is required.

### Home / Crop isolation

Selector and Registry are shared; orchestrator is shared. Crop has an intentional scholarly-overlap concurrency policy. No isolation defect was confirmed.

### Failure criteria

FC-1 through FC-7 were mapped to existing protections and missing expansion-specific tests. The report recommended per-source identity, filter-drop, evidence-identity, Home/Crop enablement, and gate-bypass regression coverage as the expansion proceeds.

### GO-0 readiness

The report marked:
- extension boundary understood: YES
- question/answer identity invariants mapped: YES
- Builder vs Compiler clarified: YES
- documentation home strategy defined: YES
- 62 list authoritative in audit/chat: YES
- 62 list in Git: NO
- first source chosen: NO
- implementation: NO

Therefore GO-0 is ready for the human documentation-placement decision and subsequent authorized registration of the 62-source list.

## 4. Current decision after STEP-1

1. Preserve CSQ as the immutable semantic authority.
2. Preserve scientific answer identity through evidence/validation/Composer contracts.
3. Preserve strong query construction by compiling one scientific intent into source-appropriate representations without redefining the question.
4. Do not introduce a separate Source Integration Layer.
5. Use Adapter + Registry (+ Selector for auto-selected sources) as the source-extension boundary.
6. Keep ScientificQueryCompiler metadata-only unless a later, separately authorized architectural decision changes this.
7. Do not modify CSQ, RSC, or AnswerComposer merely to add ordinary transport adapters.
8. Do not select a first source in this record.
9. Proceed next to GO-0-A: formally register and freeze the 62-source master list in the repository.
10. Future Cursor prompts and Cursor reports for this phase are to be archived chronologically in this decision record / expansion documentation without silently deleting historical material.

## 5. Next step

**GO-0-A — تثبيت الـ62-Source Master List**

Scope: documentation-only registration of the already-established 62 identities. No source selection and no implementation.
